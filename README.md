Generates random words. You can choose parts of speech from the list below with boolean operator support. Variable names suck, and use of classes suck too but I made this only a few weeks into learning to code.

Acceptable parts of speech:
    verb
    noun
    pronoun 
    adjective 
    adverb
    preposition 
    conjunction 
    interjection 

Acceptable usage of boolean operators:

  You CANNOT mix boolean operators.
    
  {part#} refers to a part of speech from the list above
  
  Not:
  
    Excludes certain parts of speech from the search. Usage: 
      not {part1} not {part2} not {part3}
    This will produce 1 output, excluding words with those parts of speech.
    
  And: 
  
    Produces one of each part of speech listed. Usage: 
      {part1} and {part2} and {part3}
    This will produce 3 outputs, each one a different part of speech
  Or: 
  
    Produces one part of speech from the listed parts. Usage: 
      {part1} or {part2} or {part3}
    This will produce 1 output, with only words from the selected parts of speech.
